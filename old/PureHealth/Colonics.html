						<h2>What is Colonic Hydrotherapy</h2>
						<p>Colonic Hydrotherapy is an internal bath to help cleanse the colon (large intestine) of poisons, gas, accumulated faecal matter and the mucus deposits. Fully disposable equipment is used to flush filtered water through the colon to help expel waste products and compacted deposits.</p>
						
						<h2>How does it work</h2>
						<p>The colon is the last five feet or so of intestinal tube, approximately five feet in length. Food waste enters into the colon from the small intestines in a fluid state and water, minerals and vitamins are then reabsorbed and toxins and other waste materials eliminated through the rectum. Therefore if the colon is not functioning correctly, many disorders can result, including constipation, diverticulitis, haemorrhoids, colitis and even bowel cancer. The Royal Society of Medicine published a report stating that toxicity in the intestines can be a contributing cause to sleep disorders, mental and physical depression, skin problems, breast cancer, bladder infections, headaches, as well as digestive disorders.</p>
						
						<h2>What Colonic Hydrotherapy can help</h2>
						<p>The Health Education Council, National Advisory Committee on Nutrition Education (September 1983) reported that 85% of the population have slow bowel movements with as many as 40% of the population in the United Kingdom being regularly constipated. When the colon does not function properly, other eliminating organs (e.g., skin, kidneys, lungs and lymph) become overloaded and subsequently they too become affected.</p>
						<p>Colonic hydrotherapy can assist in the treatment of thrush, bad breath, colitis, and flatulence. Obvious relief from bloating and constipation, toxic headaches, painful haemorrhoids and skin problems. In the longer term, bowel disease risks are also diminished and nutrients better absorbed leading to improved all round health. Most people quickly experience improved mental clarity after a colonic, with their toxic load diminished and elimination improved, a greater feeling of well being and lightness is felt.</p>
						<p>Many disorders can result, including irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, diverticulitis, haemorrhoids, colitis and even bowel cancer. The Royal Society of Medicine published a report stating that toxicity in the intestines can be a contributing cause to sleep disorders, mental and physical depression, skin problems, breast cancer, bladder infections, headaches, as well as digestive disorders. Colonic treatment benefits can often be quickly observed in the form of improved bowel function together with clearer skin, more mental clarity, and fewer headaches. Circulatory, immune and weight problems often also improve with colonic treatment. It can also help with the following:</p>
