						<p> As a Naturopathic Doctor, Nutritionist and colonic hydrotherapist, my aim is to head off disease and illness before it gets a chance to emerge, after all prevention is always better than cure. Illness to me is not about giving you a drug to mask the affects, it is about finding the root cause of the problem to prevent it from developing into something more serious. If you have headaches, the answer is not to give you painkillers to get rid of the headaches but, to find out why you are getting the headaches. I have 12 years experience in the field of natural medicine and it is not just my job it is my passion. I will always treat my own family and friends naturally and firmly believe that if you look after yourself and you can spot the early warning signs, the natural approach is always the best initial option.</p>
						
						<p>While you may choose to see a naturopath as your family doctor, my primary focus is on a natural approach to health care.  Homeopathy, hydrotherapy, clinical nutrition and lifestyle counselling are among the typical treatments that you could expect to receive, depending on your needs.</p>
						
						<p>Education also plays a vital role in the world of naturopathic medicine. "Naturopathic doctors really believe in educating patients and engaging them in their own health care,"  "I want you to feel empowered and take ownership over your health."</p>

						<p>No-one doubts that self-repair is a vital phenomenon. However, modern medicine has moved away from the classic principle that all healing is self-healing. No drug or surgery actually heals; its value is in reducing pain and distress, returning an acceptable function and at best enabling spontaneous repair to occur when it had previously been prevented.</p>

						<p>As a Natural therapists I have no problem with the modern allopathic (conventional medicine) strategy; in many circumstances, it is certain that it can save lives and protect health in ways inconceivable to pre-scientific medicine.</p>

						<p>It is unhealthy cells that lead to disease – disease does not cause unhealthy cells. This is an important distinction. You contract a disease because you are sick. Not, you are sick because you have a disease.</p>

						<p>My approach seeks to treat the whole person: physical, emotional, social, and spiritual.</p>

<p>I am the mother of two beautiful children and originally studied Law at Bristol as I was intent on being a Barrister. I then came across Colonic Hydrotherapy and tried it. I was so amazed at the results that I decided to train as a Colonic Hydrotherapist myself. That was 12 years ago and I have done several case studies and written several papers and articles that have been published. Along the way I suffered from a very bad illness and was fed up taking medication that made me groggy and did not help me in the long run, so I looked into alternative ways of treating my condition. I have completely changed, my diet and lifestyle and I have never felt or been healthier. That is when I decided to train as a Naturopath and Nutritionist. I always treat my friends and family naturally and I truly believe, from personal experience that you can cure anything with the right diet and lifestyle. I am always innovating and using new machines and products to keep colonic hydrotherapy and natural medicine in the 21'st century and so all my patients can get the best possible results.  love my job as I know that what I do can truly help people for the long term.  I do not consider what I do “work” as I am so passionate about it. My aim in life is to end up with two well rounded happy children and to let as many people as I can know that you don;t always have to go for the conventional ways of treating illness and disease, and to prove that your body and mind are stronger and more capable of self healing than you think. </p>
