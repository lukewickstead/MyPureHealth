		<div class="title">Colloidal Silver Benefits</div>
		
		<p>
			Colloidal silver is a health supplement that is created by immersing tiny particles of silver in a colloidal base solution. It is consumed by those who would like to stave off such serious health ailments as cancer, AIDS and herpes. Silver is thought to make the immune system more active and thereby more effective at fending off disease. It is most commonly available in a liquid form that is dispensed with a dropper. Clear or pale yellow colloidal silver is the best as the particle size affects the colour of the solution and the larger particles produce a darker coloured liquid but they are not easily absorbed by the body.

		<h2>History of Use</h2>
		<p>
			Before the invention of antibacterial soap, colloidal silver was used as a disinfectant. It is still most commonly used to kill bacteria. Silver is effective at both preventing and combating bacterial illnesses and infections because it does not corrode. In ancient times silver was used in wound dressings and it was frequently used for the same purposes in America following the Civil War. It is also why churches use silver chalices in Communion to stop disease spreading through the congregation. Silver fell out of favour with the advent of regulated synthesised medications but has become popular again along with lifestyle trends that promote natural organic food.

		<h2>Blue Bloods</h2>
		<p> 
			Even thousands of years ago, Ancient Greeks realised that the rich families who ate, drank and stored food in silverware were much less likely to be ill than the commoners who ate from ceramics and used iron utensils. The rich people developed a slight blue tinge to their skin from years of silver ingestion, hence the term Blue Bloods was born. (This was not the only reason they were called Blue Bloods. It was also as they mostly avoided working outdoors in the fields, and they tended to marry within their own social group, so they maintained their very pale skin and hence their veins appeared blue through their skin. Blood is not actually blue, although it does become a deeper maroon colour when it has given most of its oxygen to the body and is travelling back to the lungs and heart in veins, compared to the bright red colour of blood in arteries fresh from the lungs and full of oxygen. But blood is never actually blue, it simply appears that way with mostly pale skinned people due to the absorption of light by the blood, reflection of light by the skin, as well as colour perception. It is actually surprisingly complex to explain exactly why we observe veins to be blue in pale skinned people!).

		<h2>How it Works</h2>
		<p> 
			Proponents of colloidal silver claim that it is effective against every virus and illness and that it has never reacted dangerously with other medications. Scientific studies have shown that pure silver quickly kills bacteria. It even kills the super-bacteria that evolve after conventional disinfecting agents kill the weak strains of bacteria. Silver acts as a catalyst and disables an enzyme that facilitates actions inside cells. It is not consumed in the process so it is available to keep working again and again. The enzyme silver destroys is required by anaerobic bacteria, viruses, yeast and mold. (Unfriendly bacteria tend to be anaerobic and friendly bacteria aerobic). This is the action that destroys pathogens. It stops them from using the body's own cells as vehicles for replication. Colloidal silver creates an environment that makes it impossible for pathogens to survive and multiply.  Since it is not designed to combat a specific pathogen but rather works against the very nature of their life cycles, it is an effective preventative agent against all illnesses caused by all pathogens including future mutations. There is no known disease-causing organism that can live in the presence of even minute traces of colloidal silver. Laboratory tests show that anaerobic bacteria, virus, and fungus organisms are all killed within minutes of contact. Parasites are also killed whilst still in their egg stage. Colloidal Silver is effective against infections, colds, influenza, fermentation and parasitic infestations. Colloidal Silver is touted as a treatment for HIV and AIDS. These claims have not been recognised by the medical community but there is no denying the lengthy survival rates of some AIDS patients who swear by colloidal silver. The same mechanism that hinders the replication of pathogens also seems to prevent the body from developing cancer. Cancerous tumours form when the cells' internal regulators stop working. The cells divide at a rate that outstrips the body's need for them. Colloidal silver re-calibrates cells' rates of division. When colloidal silver is used as a broad-spectrum viral and bacterial preventative it may cure other seemingly unrelated ailments. People who have sustained severe burns can use colloidal silver to promote healthy cell growth and fend off infections. It reduces the appearance of acne that is bacterial in origin. It helps maintain a healthy digestive environment and it maximises the amount of nutrients that the body is able to extract from food. Colloidal silver makes it impossible for parasites to flourish and lay their eggs. Colloidal Silver is also effective as a digestive aid when taken with meals as it stops fermentation of food in the stomach and intestines. Fermentation can occur if food sits there for too long and this can lead gas, bloating, pain, indigestion and re-flux, so taking silver can help avoid all these unpleasant symptoms which a lot of people suffer with after meals. Silver has also been known to destroy water-borne parasites and to filter out impurities.
