							There is a path back to the way you once were. You don’t need to settle for feeling like you’re 90 years old when you’re in the prime of your life.  And you don’t have to endure a poor quality of life taking multiple medications. So if you’re sick and tired of being sick and tired, ready to make yourself a priority and invest in your health and well-being, we can work together!
						</p>
						<p>
							So how do you combat life’s inevitable stresses? How do you get back your energy… your good mood… good digestion, balanced hormones and the lovely figure you once had or are looking to have? How do you restore all of that despite the bad traffic, bad day at work, active kids and all the other stresses of daily life?
						</p>
						<p>
							You need the right eating habits, proper supplementation and dedication to improving your health. That’s where I come in!
						</p>
						<p>
							As a  Nutritional Consultant, I can help you deal with the stress in your life and FEEL GOOD… AGAIN! 
						</p>
						<p>
							I educate you about the connection between food and health by teaching good eating habits that you can share with family and friends. You will receive a personal, customised nutrition program (dietary suggestions and a supplementation plan) so you know how to nourish your body to help repair and restore itself. I work with you to find solutions to manage daily stress and make changes that fit your lifestyle. We work together until your nutritional deficiencies are under control and proper bodily functions are restored as much as possible
						</p>
						<p>
							I will work with you, listen to you, and empower you to balance your diet, lose weight, prevent chronic disease, or eat right - whatever your goals may be.
						</p>
						<p>
							A few examples of the things I can help with are:
